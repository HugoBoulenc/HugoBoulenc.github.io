I provide end-to-end support in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Physics-informed modeling**, from scientific state-of-the-art reviews to full model development and delivery.  
The following missions illustrate typical engagement formats. **Each mission can be fully customized to match the client’s objectives, data, and context.**
