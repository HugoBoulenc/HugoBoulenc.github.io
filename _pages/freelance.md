## 🔍 Short Mission Example (< 10 workdays): State of the Art Review

### Milestone 0: Kick-off & Down Payment

- **Objective:** Define the scope, objectives, and success criteria of the mission, and align on data, timelines, and deliverables.

- **Payment:** 20% of the total price.

### Milestone 1: State of the Art & Scientific Watch

- **Objective:** Establish a clear and structured overview of the scientific landscape on a given topic.

- **Scope:**

  - Audit of approaches previously developed by the client
  - Literature review of approximately 3 key scientific publications
  - Comparison of ~3 major methods through a structured table (advantages / limitations)

- **Deliverables:**

  - Concise report (~5 pages) including a comparative table  
  - Oral presentation with slides

- **Payment:** 80% of the total price.
