![Illustration showing my interests](/images/image_about_cropped.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at INSA Toulouse and Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT). <br>
My current research topic lies in Physics-Informed Machine Learning for floods simulation

My research interests are in (Physics-Informed) Machine Learning 🤖, Fluid Dynamics 🌊 and Earth Observation 🌍. 
I also want to use Machine Learning & Maths to solve today's important problems, such as environmental issues 🌱, climate urgency 🔥 or social inequalities ⚖️
